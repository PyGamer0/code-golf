# code-golf
All my non-trivial code golf answers from Stack Exchange and other sites since the end of August 2020.(TopAnswers, Reddit, etc.)
Basically, whichever ones that took a good amount of effort from my end to make.
I might've missed a few here and there.


# Organization
Most of this repo is organized by language.

I'll be adding my esolang submissions(the non-trivial solutions) to this list as well(APL, dzaima/APL, Pip, Vyxal, etc..).

If I do have time, most of the difficult answers will have better explanations and versioning(number of bytes saved on each iteration, stuff like that.)

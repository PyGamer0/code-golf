# code-golf
All my code golf answers from Stack Exchange and other sites(TopAnswers, Reddit, etc.)

# Organization
Most of this repo is organized by language.

I'll be adding my esolang submissions(the non-trivial solutions) to this list as well(APL, dzaima/APL, Pip, Vyxal, etc..).

If I do have time, most of the difficult answers will have better explanations and versioning(number of bytes saved on each iteration, stuff like that.)

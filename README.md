# My Code Golf answers

Contains programs that I've posted on:
- Code Golf Stack Exchange
- Anarchy Golf (http://golf.shinh.org)
- TopAnswers (https://topanswers.xyz/codegolf)
- Codidact (https://codegolf.codidact.org)

These may be answers, reference implementations for questions, or just programs made for fun.

Code Golf Stack Exchange answers will have their answer ID next to them(most of them will).

You can see the original answers using:
```
https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/<answer ID>/80214
```

I'll be doing a similar convention for Codidact and other sites as well.
